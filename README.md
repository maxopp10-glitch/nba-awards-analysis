🏀 NBA MVP Awards — Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes NBA MVP (Most Valuable Player) award selections to identify the key performance factors that historically influence MVP outcomes. The objective is to demonstrate a structured, data-driven analytical approach, transforming raw sports data into clear insights and well-supported conclusions.

Although based on sports data, the analytical methods applied are directly transferable to business, product, and performance analytics contexts.

🎯 Objectives

Identify performance metrics most strongly associated with MVP selection

Analyze the relationship between individual performance and team success

Explore historical trends and consistency in award decisions

Demonstrate end-to-end analytical thinking, from data preparation to insights

📊 Dataset & Scope

Historical NBA player and team performance data

Multiple seasons analyzed to ensure trend consistency

Metrics include:

Individual statistics (efficiency, scoring, impact metrics)

Team performance indicators (wins, standings)

Comparative season-level analysis

🛠 Tools & Methods

Excel (Advanced)

Data cleaning and structuring

Pivot tables and calculated metrics

Comparative and trend analysis

Analytical Techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Comparative analysis across seasons

Pattern and outlier identification

Data validation and consistency checks

Documentation

Clear assumptions and methodology

Reproducible analysis steps

Insight-driven narrative

🔍 Key Analysis & Insights

MVP selections show strong correlation with elite individual performance combined with team success

Certain advanced performance metrics are consistently present among MVP winners

Outlier cases were identified and analyzed to understand exceptions to typical patterns

The analysis reinforces the importance of contextual performance evaluation, not single metrics

📈 Business & Analytical Value

This project demonstrates skills highly relevant to Data Analyst roles, including:

Translating raw data into actionable insights

Evaluating performance drivers and KPIs

Applying structured reasoning to complex datasets

Communicating findings through clear narratives and visual summaries

Maintaining analytical rigor, accuracy, and documentation standards
