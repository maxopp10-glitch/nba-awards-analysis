# NBA Awards Analysis (1989–2024)

This project analyzes historical NBA award winners to understand how the statistical profiles of elite players have evolved over time.  
The focus is on identifying long-term trends, efficiency shifts, and changes in evaluation criteria for major individual awards.

The analysis is fully exploratory and descriptive, using Excel-based data analysis techniques rather than machine learning.

---

## Awards Analyzed

The project focuses on three major NBA individual awards:

- **Most Valuable Player (MVP)**
- **Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY)**
- **Rookie of the Year (ROY)**

---

## Key Analytical Questions

This analysis was guided by the following questions:

- How have MVP evaluation criteria shifted from raw production to efficiency?
- Is modern defensive excellence driven more by per-minute impact than total defensive volume?
- Are recent Rookie of the Year winners contributing less immediate impact than earlier generations?
- Which statistical metrics are most strongly correlated with award-winning seasons?
- How do trends differ across MVP, DPOY, and ROY awards over multiple decades?

---

## Metrics Used

All metrics are analyzed at the **player-season level**.

### Production
- Points per Game (PTS)
- Rebounds per Game (TRB)
- Assists per Game (AST)

### Defense
- Steals per Game (STL)
- Blocks per Game (BLK)

### Efficiency
- Field Goal Percentage (FG%)

### Impact
- Win Shares (WS)
- Win Shares per 48 Minutes (WS/48)

---

## Project Structure

  Cleaned and structured player-season datasets for each award.

- **MVP_Decade_Summary / DPOY_Decade_Summary / ROY_Decade_Summary**  
  Decade-level pivot table summaries and comparative visualizations.

- **MVP_Evolution / DPOY_Evolution / ROY_Evolution**  
  Year-by-year trend analysis of key metrics.

- **Correlation_MVP / Correlation_DPOY**  
  Correlation analysis identifying which metrics most strongly relate to WS and WS/48.

- **Final_Insights_MVP / Final_Insights_DPOY / Final_Insights_ROY**  
  High-level conclusions and narrative insights for each award.

- **Final_Insights_Overall**  
  League-wide synthesis comparing how MVP, DPOY, and ROY evaluation criteria have evolved.

## Key Findings (High-Level)

### MVP
- Long-term increase in scoring (PTS) and shooting efficiency (FG%).
- Total impact (WS) remains relatively stable across decades.
- Win Shares per 48 minutes (WS/48) shows a clear upward trend.
- Modern MVPs generate elite value through efficiency rather than raw volume.

### DPOY
- Decline in raw defensive volume metrics (TRB, BLK) over time.
- WS/48 remains stable or slightly increases, indicating improved per-minute defensive efficiency.
- Defensive excellence has become more role-specific and system-driven.

### ROY
- Consistent decline in both WS and WS/48 across decades.
- Earlier ROY winners contributed more immediate on-court impact.
- Modern ROYs are integrated more gradually, emphasizing development and long-term potential.

### League-Wide Trend
Across all awards, the NBA has shifted from volume-based dominance toward:
- Efficiency
- Contextual value
- Role optimization
- Per-minute impact
- Long-term player trajectory
